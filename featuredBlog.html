        <h2>Where to sleep when on the trail</h2>
        <p>Let's face it, all the best trails are miles away from the city. That is just the nature of the beast with off-roading. It is probably one of the contributing factors as to why we love off-roading so much. To get away from the hustle and bustle of our daily lives and get far away from people. So where do you sleep when you are out on the trail? The simple answer, you camp. But that doesn't mean you have to pitch a tent and sleep on the ground if you don't want to. We broke down some of the pros and cons of traditional tents, rooftop tents, and even 4x4 camper vans for those seeking luxury and adventure.</p>
        <h3>Traditional Tents</h3>
        <p>Tent camping can be broken down into 2 catagories, backpacking tents and traditional tents. Backpacking tents are typically smaller and lighter. They are designed to be strapped to a hiking bag and taken with you deep into the trail. Traditional tents are usually larger and a bit more cumbersome to carry around, but they afford a lot more ammenities than a backpacking tent. These tents are designed to be set up in a campground like space. These are great for families or people travelling with pets</p>
        <p>Here are a few of our favorites from our friends over at REI
          <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/168205/rei-co-op-groundbreaker-2-tent">2 Person Tent</a>
          <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/189399/eureka-copper-canyon-lx-8-person-tent">8 Person Tent</a>
          <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/168564/rei-co-op-flash-air-1-tent">1 Person Tent</a></p>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tents offer more availability when it comes to deciding where to camp.</li>
          <li>Tents typically offer more space</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tents can be cumbersome to carry around or assemble</li>
          <li>Sleeping on the ground</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rooftop tents</h3>
        <p>Rooftop tents are specifically designed to be an all in one solution to car camping. They attach to your vehicle (rooftop or bed rack) and are designed to quickly and easily fold out no matter where you decide to stop for the night. They are usually large enough to accommodate 2 people and maybe a dog. The downside is that almost all of them require a ladder to access the space. You may also be limited by terrain or regulation as to where you can camp.</p>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to set up</li>
          <li>Already attached to your vehicle so minimal space being used</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>May be limited by where you can camp</li>
          <li>If using a bed rack, may limit bed usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4X4 Camper/Van</h3>
        <p>Off roading campers and van builds are an interesting solution to having comfort with your adventure. Most campers or vans are or can be fully outfitted with a bed and a kitchen. You can expect all of the comforts of home while out enjoying the wide open country. They do come with their own set of challenges as well though. Most van builds come in 2WD or AWD models. Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans and Ford E-Series vans can also be found in 4X4 models, or you can have a conversion done. The major downside of van builds, is the actual building part. For those of us that aren't as mechanically inclined, there are many services out there that will do the whole conversion for you. A big upside of a van conversion over a rooftop or traditional tent would be stealth camping. It is a lot easier to park a van on the side of the road and crawl in the back for the night than it is to pitch an entire tent.</p>
        <p>Check out our friends from Changing Lanes Wheel Estate for inspiration on your next van build.</p>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Comfort</li>
          <li>Style</li>
          <li>Stealth Camping</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Vehicle trail capabilities</li>
          <li>Cost to build</li>
          <li>Restrictions around where you can park and camp</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>So it really just depends on the type of trails, your style of camping, and how comfortable you want to be. Traditional camping is usually a great place to start. It is cheap and easy to go pick up a tent from a store and hit the trail. Rooftop tents are a little bit more expensive and take a little bit of work to install them, but once they are set up you are good to go. No need to buy a new vehicle or go through the build process. These are a great option for those that are more interested in blazing through the trail and would just like an easy comfortable place to sleep. Camper vans are definitely the hardest of these go start off in. They can be costly and time consuming. Luckily we teamed up with our friends over at Changing Lanes Wheel Estate to bring our readers an exclusive offer. Let them know we sent you to get a free consultation on your dream van build.</p>
